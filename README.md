# TravelBot AI: Your Personalized Travel Guide

## Project Description
TravelBot AI is a conversational assistant designed to inspire and assist travelers. It provides detailed information about destinations, suggests activities, and helps users make the most of their trips. By addressing the common challenges travelers face, such as information overload, lack of inspiration, and time-consuming searches, TravelBot AI simplifies trip planning and enhances the travel experience.

## Problem Statement
Planning travel can be daunting due to the fragmented and overwhelming nature of online information. Searching for travel details often consumes significant time, and the results might not align with what the user is looking for. Travelers need a tool that can quickly provide accurate and targeted information.

The problem includes:
- Difficulty in finding reliable, up-to-date travel insights.
- Time-consuming searches online, with results often failing to meet the user's specific needs.
- Lack of personalization in available travel recommendations.
- Limited access to creative and inspiring travel ideas.

TravelBot AI solves these issues by delivering reliable, personalized, and engaging travel advice in real time, helping users find the information they need quickly and precisely.

## Dataset
The project uses the **SQuAD v2 (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)**, a comprehensive dataset containing context-rich paragraphs and questions with corresponding answers. This dataset ensures the chatbot has a robust understanding of language and can provide precise responses.

## Approach
The project leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** framework implemented with **DSPy**:
1. **Data Retrieval:** Uses **ChromadbRM** as the retriever model to fetch relevant context from the SQuAD v2 dataset.
2. **Answer Generation:** Employs the **Mistral 7B** model via **Ollama** to generate coherent, informative, and engaging responses tailored to user queries.
3. **Evaluation Framework:** Implements robust metrics to continuously evaluate the chatbot's performance, including:
    - **Precision**
    - **Recall**
    - **F1-Score**
    - **ROUGE**: Measures n-gram and sequence overlaps.
    - **BLEU**: Evaluates the accuracy of generated answers against reference answers.

## Solution Overview
TravelBot AI was built to:
1. **Aggregate and curate reliable travel information** for diverse destinations and activities.
2. **Personalize recommendations** by considering user preferences and interests.
3. **Inspire users** with creative and lesser-known travel suggestions.
4. **Provide targeted answers** quickly and efficiently, reducing the time users spend searching for information.
5. **Ensure accuracy** by evaluating responses with robust NLP metrics and iterative feedback.

## Pipeline Implementation
The project implemented a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using **DSPy**, consisting of:
- **Retriever Model:** **ChromadbRM**, an efficient model for retrieving relevant context.
- **Generator Model:** **Mistral 7B** deployed via **Ollama**, capable of generating high-quality, context-aware answers.

## Evaluation Framework
To ensure quality and relevance of responses, the chatbot's outputs are evaluated using:
1. **Precision:** Measures the proportion of relevant information retrieved.
2. **Recall:** Evaluates the completeness of the generated responses.
3. **F1-Score:** Combines precision and recall into a balanced metric.
4. **ROUGE:** Captures n-gram overlaps to assess language similarity:
    - **ROUGE-1**
    - **ROUGE-2**
    - **ROUGE-L**
5. **BLEU:** Scores the accuracy of generated answers compared to ground truth answers.

## How the Problem Was Addressed
1. **Dataset Integration:** Incorporated the SQuAD v2 dataset as the primary source of structured and unstructured travel information.
2. **Pipeline Implementation:** Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with DSPy for accurate and context-aware response generation.
3. **Evaluation Framework:** Designed a robust evaluation pipeline using NLP metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, precision, recall, and F1-score) to assess the chatbot's performance.
4. **User-Centric Approach:** Developed personalized recommendations and quick retrieval of targeted information, saving users time and providing inspiration for their travel plans.

## Future Enhancements
- **Real-Time Updates:** Incorporate dynamic information, such as live events, weather, and travel restrictions.
- **Improved Personalization:** Enhance user preference modeling with advanced machine learning techniques.
- **Multimedia Integration:** Provide rich content, such as images and videos, to create a more immersive user experience.
- **Expansion of Knowledge Base:** Add more sources and integrate APIs from trusted travel platforms for real-time data.

TravelBot AI is built to be the ultimate travel companion, offering personalized, accurate, and inspiring travel guidance for users worldwide.
